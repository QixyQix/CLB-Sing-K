Designed by a former [Chinese Language Basic (CLB)](https://www.languagecouncils.sg/mandarin/en/learning-resources/singaporean-mandarin-database/terms/chinese-language-b-syllabus) student, for fellow CLB people who want to sing along, but cannot read traditional chinese, or need pinyin assistance.

## Settings

Upon clicking the plugin, a settings menu should show. The plugin provides 3 settings:

1. Chinese Character - Select whether to display:
   - Simplified Chinese (default)
   - Traditional Chinese
2. Pinyin
   - Small text (default)
   - Regular size text
   - Disabled
3. Pinyin Preference
   - zh-Hans(CN) (default)
   - zh-Hant(TW)

**A note about pinyin preference:** There are some characters that have 2 ways of pronouncing. For instance, the character `Ëêé` has 2 pronunciations:
- `wƒõi` for zh-Hans (CN) - third tone
- `wƒìi` for zh-Hant (TW) - first tone

You may choose either setting based on the origins of the songs which you're listening to.
